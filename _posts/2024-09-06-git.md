title: Intro to version control and git (work in progress)

## Version control overview

1. **Centralized version control systems:**  
everyone connects to a central server for the latest copy of the code

2. **Distributed version control systems:**  
everyone have a copy and is shared between people

## Version control and git

Understanding purpose of git and how to use it effectively was pretty confusing, but I found a very good video on Youtube that explains the basic [here](https://youtu.be/8JJ101D3knE?feature=shared)

(Youtube tutorial is the best!)

## git from my understanding:

git is important to track code history and collaborate with others

you can compare changes to code

## How to use git: 
1. command line
2. code editor/ide
3. GUI (git kraken/source tree etc.)

## setting up git

to set up git:

first you need to config git in your terminal:

```bash
git config --global username "your name"
#
git config --global user.email youremail@domain.com
# 
```


start using git to track version with bash
```bash
cd C:\\path\\to\\folder
# changes the working directory to the path you put

git init
# this commands creates a .git folder in your current directory, so that you can start track using git

```

## git config commands:

> git --version (gets the version of git installed)     
> git config --global user.name "name" (configures the name)    
> git config --global user.email "email" (configures the email)     
> git config --global core.editor "code --wait" (sets the default editor to VScode)     
> git config --global -e (opens up the configuration file)      
> git config --global core.autocrlf true (for windows end of line)  
> git config --global core.autocrlf input (for mac/linux end of line)   
> git config --help     
> git config -h (short summary of commands)     

## basic git commands:
> git status (tracks the changes and > commits made)
> git add "file1.extension" "file2.> extension" (adds the file(s) to the > staging area)
> git add . (adds the entire directory> (sometimes you don't want this > because there might be large log > files ))
> git add *txt (adds all files with > that extenstion pattern to the > staging area)
> echo "something">"file.extension"> (standard linux/unix command for > writing content to a file)
> echo "something">>"file.extension" > (append)
> mkdir "name of directory" (make an > empty directory in the path)
> cd "c:\\path\\to\\directory" (change > directory path)
> git init (initalises empty git sub > directory with in the main directory)
> ls   (list the files and directories > in the path)
> ls -a (lists all the files and > directories in the path, including hidden ones)





---------------------------------------------------------------
git bash(bourne against shell):

provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience, emulates linux/unix environment

------------------------------------------

git settings:
name
email
default editor 
line ending

---------------------------------------
# end of line

git have a end of line configuration that lets different operating systems work together.

windows systems have two end of line types, carriage return, and line feed, while mac/linux systems only have line feed.

to make collaborations work, the carriage return needs to be removed when window users checks into the git repository.

windows: \r carriage return, \n line feed 
git need to remove carriage return from end of lines when checking in code into the repository and add the end of lines back when checking out code from the repository

macOS/linux: \n line feed 
git need to remove the end of line when storing code if it is acccidentally added

-------------------------------------------------
configuration can be specified at three levels:
system - all users
global - all repository of the current users
local - only the current repository

---------------------------------
