# Intro to version control and git

understanding how to use git was pretty confusing for the first time, but I found a very good video on Youtube on it. (seriously Youtube probably have a tutorial for everything(link to how to fold your clothes)) #some emotes/gifs here.

# What git is (from my understanding)

# Ways to version control

> **Centralized version control systems:**  
where everyone connects to a central server for the latest copy of the code

> **Distributed version control systems:**  
everyone have a copy and is shared between people

git falls within the latter category


# Intro to git:

git - important to track code history and collaborate with others

---------------------------------------------------------------
## git config commands:

> git --version (gets the version of git installed)     
> git config --global user.name "name" (configures the name)    
> git config --global user.email "email" (configures the email)     
> git config --global core.editor "code --wait" (sets the default editor to VScode)     
> git config --global -e (opens up the configuration file)      
> git config --global core.autocrlf true (for windows end of line)  
> git config --global core.autocrlf input (for mac/linux end of line)   
> git config --help     
> git config -h (short summary of commands)     

## basic git commands:
git status (tracks the changes and commits made)
git add "file1.extension" "file2.extension" (adds the file(s) to the staging area)
git add . (adds the entire directory(sometimes you don't want this because there might be large log files ))
git add *txt (adds all files with that extenstion pattern to the staging area)
echo "something">"file.extension"(standard linux/unix command for writing content to a file)
echo "something">>"file.extension" (append)
mkdir "name of directory" (make an empty directory in the path)
cd "c:\\path\\to\\directory" (change directory path)
git init (initalises empty git sub directory with in the main directory)
ls   (list the files and directories in the path)
ls -a (lists all the files and directories in the path, including hidden ones)



# How to use git: 
1. command line
2. code editor/ide
3. GUI (git kraken/source tree etc.)

---------------------------------------------------------------
git bash(bourne against shell):

provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience, emulates linux/unix environment

------------------------------------------

git settings:
name
email
default editor 
line ending

---------------------------------------
# end of line

git have a end of line configuration that lets different operating systems work together.

windows systems have two end of line types, carriage return, and line feed, while mac/linux systems only have line feed.

to make collaborations work, the carriage return needs to be removed when window users checks into the git repository.

windows: \r carriage return, \n line feed 
git need to remove carriage return from end of lines when checking in code into the repository and add the end of lines back when checking out code from the repository

macOS/linux: \n line feed 
git need to remove the end of line when storing code if it is acccidentally added

-------------------------------------------------
configuration can be specified at three levels:
system - all users
global - all repository of the current users
local - only the current repository
