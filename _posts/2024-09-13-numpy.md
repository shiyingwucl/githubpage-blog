# NumPy is?

Python library that is built for working with arrays, faster than the built-in python list

you can store:

## Why NumPy is faster

- stores stuff with less bytes compared to python list

- no type checking when iterating through through objects

- contiguous memory (things are stored right next to each other)

So numpy is good to use when working with large sets of data

## Lists vs NumPy

numpy can do all of the things that lists could plus alpha (like multiplying arrays)

## Uses of NumPy

- Maths (MAT)
- Plotting (Matplotlib)
- Backend (of Pandas, Connect 4)
- Machine learning
