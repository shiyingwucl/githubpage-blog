# Packages in Python

Today I am starting to learn python packages and I'm using this [video](https://youtu.be/GUXxLy68EF8) for reference.

## Overview

### module vs packages vs libraries

> - Module: python file with some functionalities>(classes,functions,methods etc.)  
> - packages: contains multiple modules, contains >an \__init__ file
> - Library: multiple packages   
> - Script:     python file that is run to execute code (i.e. main.py)

It should look something like this:
![structure](/images/packages/structure.png)

```python
import Mylib 
#imports the whole library and all the packages and modules included within that library

import Mylib.Package1 
# imports the specified package ONLY

from Mylib import Package1 
# another way to write it

from Mylib import module1 
# imports the specified module ONLY

from Mylib.Package1.module1 import myfunction1
# imports ONLY the specified function in the specified module from the specified package
```
## Installing packages in python:

you need to use a package manager to install python packages, and pip (the most popular python package manager) is included by default in Python. 

pip allows users to install packages from PyPI and other repositories

## Installing packages within environment

It is best practice to install packages within created environments rather than globally

venv supports only python libraries and packages
while conda can be used for packages that are in other languages like javascript 

### command to use :

```bash
 pip install package_name
 venv install package_name
 conda install package_name
```

## Popular python libraries (and ones that sound kinda interesting to me):

### Numpy
stands for numerical python
### Pandas
### Madplotlib
### PyTorch
### Pygame
