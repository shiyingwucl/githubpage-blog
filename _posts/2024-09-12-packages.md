# Packages in Python

Today I'm starting to learning python packages, and I am referencing this [video](https://youtu.be/GUXxLy68EF8) 

## module vs packages vs libraries

> - Module: python file with some functionalities>(classes,functions,methods etc.)  
> - packages: contains multiple modules, contains >an \__init__ file
> - Library: multiple packages   
> - Script:     python file that is run to execute code (i.e. main.py)

It should look something like this:
